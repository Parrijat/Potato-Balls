While doing so, you can also add some cut veggies and spices to  the paste.
Take some cornflour in a bowl and dip the balls in it.
Take the balls out. Make sure that  excessive cornflour is not there on them. Dip the balls in hot oil.
Fry them for almost 2 minutes in oil in medium flame and take them out.
